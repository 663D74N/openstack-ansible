upgrade:
  - |
    During upgrade HA policy for RabbitMQ will be disabled and replaced with
    usage of quorum queues which is a new and more efficient way to ensure
    queues durability.

    If you want to continue using HA queues instead of quorum queues, please
    specify in your user_variables.yml:

    .. code-block:: yaml

      oslomsg_rabbit_quorum_queues: False

    If ``oslomsg_rabbit_quorum_queues`` is enabled (default behaviour),
    RabbitMQ vhosts will be re-created without leading ``/``. Ensure to
    reflect these changes in your monitoring software if vhosts are not
    auto-discovered.
    Also changing vhost name will result in prolonged downtime for services,
    as not re-configured yet backends will fail to connect to RabbitMQ until
    restart.
    It also might be worth to process upgrade with extra caution for some
    serivices that are sensetive to RabbitMQ downtime or even disabling usage
    of quorum queues for these services. Good examples of such services
    are Trove or Neutron with ML2 LXB or ML2 OVS drivers.
